Informed citizens of our information-dependent society
shoud be computer-literate, which means that they should be
able to use computers as everyday problem-solving devices. They
should be aware of the potential of computers to influence the
quality of life.
There was a time when only priviliged people had an opportunity
to learn the basics, called the three R's: reading, writing,
and arithmetics. Now, as we are quickly becoming an information-
becoming society, it is time to restate this right as the right
to learn reading, writing and computing. There is little doubt that
computers and their many applications are among the most significant
technical achievements of the century. They bring with
them both economic and social changes. "Computing" is a concept
that embraces not only the old third R, arithmetics, but also
a new idea — computer literacy.
